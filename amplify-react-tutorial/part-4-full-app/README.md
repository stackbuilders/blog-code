## About The Tutorial

This tutorial aims to give an introduction to creating serverless web applications in the cloud. There are several providers of serverless tools, but this time we will work with AWS Amplify which allows grouping and managing the tools that the application will use from a single console and with a single CLI.

We will create a React application that allows authentication through Cognito, create endpoints to Lambda functions, save data in Dynamo DB, and additionally we will configure a CI/CD pipeline.

### Pre-requisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

It will make it easier to follow this tutorial if you are familiar with JS, React, basic CLI commands, and Git

You will need to install:

- node v14.18 or later
- npm v6.14.4 or later
- git v2.14.1 or later

Even though knowledge of AWS is not required I would recommend having a basic understanding of what serverless is.
